## **Work Experience**  

**Total Experience**: 5.5 years, specializing in Software Engineering in Test (SDET)

### **Huawei**  

> Waterloo Centre for Software Excellence (2012 Laboratories), Canada - Research Supporter (April 2024 – Present)

- Researched state-of-the-art testing technologies to enhance QA capabilities for Huawei testing teams.  
- **Key Contributions**:  
  - **`Mobile OS Jank Detection`**: Designed and implemented algorithms leveraging SSIM and YOLO to automatically detect jank issues (e.g., screen stuttering) during mobile system testing. 
  - **`Abnormal Version Change Detection`**: Monitored performance metrics (e.g., response times) to identify performance reductions or improvements using outlier detection techniques such as iForest.  
  - **`Video Application Jank Detection`**: Automated detection of performance issues in video apps (e.g., TikTok) using SSIM and difference comparison algorithms.

### **Alibaba**  

> Local Life Service, Shanghai, China – SDET (January 2023 – July 2023)

- Ensured the quality of cloud services supporting food delivery apps, enabling features such as restaurant listings, menu displays, promotional offers, and delivery status tracking. These services supported `Eleme` (260 million monthly active users) and `AMap` (622 million monthly active users).
- **Key Contributions**:  
  - **`API Testing`**: Designed and executed test cases using Postman, modifying API parameters and call chains to validate functionality and ensure data integrity. 
  - **`Automation Testing`**: Developed Java test scripts to simulate user scenarios, incorporating parameter fuzzing to expand test coverage. 
  - **`Performance Testing`**: Designed performance test plans and utilized JMeter to send requests while monitoring server metrics (e.g., QPS, memory, CPU, IO usage) to identify performance issues.

### **TCL**  

> Internet of Things, Shenzhen, China – SDET & Test Team Leader (July 2019 – June 2022)
 
- Designed and implemented QA solutions for TCL smart home IoT ecosystems, involving voice control, apps, cloud services, and smart devices (e.g., TVs, ACs).  
- **Key Contributions**:  
  - **`Team Management`**: Integrated Agile/DevOps practices to build CI/CD workflows, boosting team efficiency by 230% and reducing testing time by 19% for 20+ product versions.  
  - **`IoT Test Framework`**: Designed and developed a Python-based test framework employing keyword, data-driven, and unittest methodologies, providing more than 44 automated solutions for diverse IoT scenarios (e.g., automating door lock controls using robot arms). 
  - **`Quality Standard Design and Execution`**: As a TSE, applied ISO25000 to define standards (e.g., acceptable unresolved bug nums for version releases). Actively participated in key meetings, such as test case review sessions, to ensure these standards were followed. 

### **Sangfor**

> Security Products, Shenzhen, China – Automation/Security Test Engineer (July 2017 – February 2019)
